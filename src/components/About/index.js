                <h3>I'm Tom, and I'm a Digital Designer & Developer from Perth, Western Australia. Welcome to my corner of the web.</h3>
                <p>Since I can remember, I've been a sucker for sports, sushi, family board game nights and most importantly, building things. From the moment I picked up my first LEGO brick as a child, the desire to turn the smallest of ideas into my own unique experiences has steadily eased me towards the digital world. This passion has finally landed me where I am today, working in Perth's Digital industry. Nothing excites me more than where user interface and experience design can take us in the future, and I'd love to be part of it!</p>
